Download all deliverables belonging to course
---

As a teacher,
I want to download all course project contents,
So that
	I can browse the students' source code, and
	I can grade the students participating in the course.

- One big tarball?
- Maybe start packaging, then send an email with download link when it is ready.
- 'Lock' the projects? Snapshot them?
