Multiple years per course context
---

As a teacher,
I want to easily create a new course context for my course for the next year,
So that I don't have to initialize a completely new course context.

- Is this really necessary? Nice to have, but might be unnecessary, if repositories/jobs can be cloned from other repositories/jobs.
