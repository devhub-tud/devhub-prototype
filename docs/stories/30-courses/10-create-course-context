As a teacher,
I want to create a course context for my course,
So that students can enroll for my course.

Given
	I am logged in as teacher, and
	I am at my dashboard page (e.g. /dashboard),
When
	I click on 'create course context ...',
Then
	I am presented with a course context creation screen (e.g. /course/create).

-- Fill in details and create context
Given
	I am presented with the course context creation screen,
When
	I enter the required information, and
	I click on 'create course context',
Then
	The course context is created, and
	The course context becomes visible on the enroll screen, and
	I am presented with a success notification, and
	I am redirected to the page of the newly created course (/course/${courseId}).

- What information should be kept on courses?
  - Code, name, description, responsible teacher, other teachers/assistents.
