Sign up for new account with two-step identification
---

As a new user,
I want to sign up for an account on the homepage,
So that I can use the system.

-- Browse to homepage
Given
	I have not logged in to the system,
When
	I browse to the system home page (e.g. http://dea.hartveld.com/devhub/),
Then
	I am presented with a login / signup screen.


-- Sign up and wait for confirmation email
Given
	I have not logged in to the system,
When
	I am presented with the signup screen, and
	I click on 'sign up', and
	I supply my TUD email, and
	I click on 'sign up',
Then
	I am presented with a screen that tells me to check my email, and
	I receive an email on that account, which contains a one-time valid URL to my account page
		(e.g. http://dea.hartveld.com/devhub/account/activate/{one-time-valid-auth-token}).


-- Activate account through link in confirmation email
Given
	I have browsed to my account page with my one-time valid URL,
When
	I supply my display name, and
	I set up a password, and
	I click 'activate',
Then
	My account is activated, and
	I receive an email that confirms this.
