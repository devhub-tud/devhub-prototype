Promote a regular user to teacher
---

As a teacher,
I want to promote a regular user to teacher,
So that the students can work as teaching assistants.

-- Looking for students to promote to teacher
Given
	I am logged in as teacher, and
	I am on the administrator dashboard (e.g. /admin),
When
	I click on 'promote user to teacher',
Then
	I am presented with a list of users (possibly in a pop-up) that can be promoted.


-- Actual promotion of students
Given
	I am presented with a list of users that can be promoted,
When
	I choose one or more users,
	And I click on 'promote users to teacher',
Then
	The chosen users are promoted (/account/{id}/promote), and
	They receive an email notification, and
	I am presented with a success message.

- We need an administrator dashboard
