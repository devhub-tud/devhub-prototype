Clean up old projects automatically
---

As an administrator,
I want that projects are cleaned up automatically after some period of time,
So that the system does not become cluttered with old projects, and I don't have to worry about this myself.

-- Automatic cleanup
Given
	The system is idle (e.g. Saturday night at 4 AM),
When
	A project is older then 180 days,
Then
	The project is deleted.

- Do we want users to be notified beforehand?
- Should users be able to extend the lifetime of their project?
