Advanced source code browser
---

As a teacher,
I want to
	browse the source code of students, and
	give comments on the quality of their code, and
	grade their code,
So that they can learn and improve from these comments.

---

- We are thinking about something like github or gitlabs, in which a teacher can leave comments on code for grading purposes.
