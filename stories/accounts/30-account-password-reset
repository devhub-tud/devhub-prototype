Reset account password
---

As a user,
I want to reset my password when I have forgotten it,
So that I can regain access to the system.

---

Given
	I am at the login screen, and
	I have forgotten my password
When
	I click on 'I forgot my password',
Then
	I am presented with the password recovery screen.


Given
	I am at the password recovery screen,
When
	I fill in my email, and
	I click on 'Reset password',
Then
	My account's password is reset, and
	I am sent a password reset token URL in an email.


Given
	I opened the password reset URL in the email,
When
	I provide a new password, and
	I click on 'Set password',
Then
	My account is accessible again, with the new password.
