Sign up for new account
---

As a new user,
I want to sign up for an account on the homepage,
So that I can use the system.

---

Given
	I have not logged in to the system,
When
	I browse to the system home page (e.g. http://dea.hartveld.com/devhub/),
Then
	I am presented with a login / signup screen.


Given
	I have not logged in to the system,
When
	I am presented with the signup screen, and
	I supply my TUD email,
Then
	I receive an email on that account,
	Which contains a one-time valid URL to my account page (e.g. http://dea.hartveld.com/devhub/account/accountId/).


Given
	I have browsed to my account page with my one-time valid URL,
When
	I supply my display name, and
	I set up a password,
Then
	My account is activated, and
	I receive an email that confirms this.
