Enroll in course
---

As a student,
I want to sign up for a course with my group,
So that I can do the practical work of the course.

Note: this could be split into two stories from an implementor's perspective: sign up for course, for individual work, and extend invitations to other students. But the parts each on their own don't have value w.r.t. the testing course.

Given
	I am logged in as student, and
	I am viewing my dashboard (e.g. /dashboard),
When
	I click on 'enroll for course...',
Then
	I am presented with a list of courses for which I can enroll.


Given
	I am viewing the list of courses for which I can enroll,
When
	I select one course from the list, and
	I click on 'enroll',
Then
	I am presented with the course project screen (e.g. /course/{courseId})


Given
	I am viewing the course project screen,
When
	I click on 'invite other students...'
Then
	I am presented with a list of students that I can invite.


Given
	I am viewing the list of students to invite,
When
	I select one or more students, and
	I click 'invite',
Then
	An invitation email is sent to the invited students, and
	I am presented with a success notification.


Given
	I have received a course project invitation email,
When
	I click on the link in the email,
Then
	I am presented with an invitation acceptance screen (e.g. /invitations/${invitationId}).


Given
	I am presented with an invitation acceptance screen,
When
	I click accept,
Then
	I am added as member to the course project, and
	The user who invited me is notified, and
	I am presented with the project screen (e.g. /projects/${projectId}).


Given
	All invitations are either accepted or rejected,
When
	A project member clicks 'provision project' on the project screen,
Then
	The project becomes immutable, and
	The project state becomes 'provisioning', and
	The system provisions the project.

Given
	The system has provisioned the project,
Then
	The system sends notification information to all project members.
